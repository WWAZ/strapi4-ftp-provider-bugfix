# strapi4-ftp-provider-bugfix

This package is a clone of [strapi4-ftp-provider](https://github.com/BaptisteAg/strapi4-ftp-provider).

It fixes the baseUrl bug and adds `${config.baseUrl}` to upload url.
@see  https://github.com/BaptisteAg/strapi4-ftp-provider/issues/6

**Just to bridge the gap:** As soon as this bug is fixed, we can do without this package and switch back to the original.
